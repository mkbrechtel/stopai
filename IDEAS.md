##  Make a case for AI safety

## Explain AI risk
- Explain AI progress (in a way that is easy to understand for non-technical people)
  - Write stories about AI progress between different versions, e.g. make a stop sign with ChatGPT 3.5 and one with ChatGPT 4.0 and show that there has been a huge improvement
- Argue that AI progress is not linear, show that there are huge jumps in progress between different versions and models
  - Chess -> Go -> Starcraft -> Medical bar
- Make a case that most people don't really get the technological progress that is happening right now
  - Also make a case that we need to take short timelines seriously

## Make political arguments
- Make a case that big tech companies are behaving irresponsibly
- Make a case that the government is not doing enough to regulate big tech companies
- Make a case that the government is not doing enough to regulate AI research
